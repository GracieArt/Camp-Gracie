# The Moderator's Handbook

## Moderating
The role of a moderator is to ensure that the core values of the server are respected. There are several procedures a moderator should know in order to ensure this:

### Moving a conversation
Sometimes people go off-topic or just send stuff to the wrong channel. In these instances, people are expected to moderate themselves, so no action is necessary on the moderator's part. If however it seems as though the people have forgotten about the channel topic and are continuing to go off topic, kindly encourage them to redirect the conversation to another channel. Examples:

"Let's keep art-related discussion in #art-talk please."

"I think you might've meant to post that in #others-art."

### De-escalation
When a person becomes emotionally compromised, it is necessary to remind them to be kind and civil, but due to their vulnerable state, care should be taken to remind them in a way that de-escalates the situation. Kindly acknowledge their feelings and suggest that the conversation end. Examples:

"I get why you're frustrated, but let's leave it to rest for now."

"You're clearly very passionate about this subject and I totally respect that, but I'm going to have to ask you to move it to DMs."

"I'm really sorry that's been happening to you, but maybe we can find somewhere else to vent about this. My DMs are open if you want to talk there." (Note that you're not obligated to invite people to your DMs, unless you're comfortable with that of course.)

### Uncredited artwork
Sometimes people forget that all art needs to be credited or sourced. If you come across a post like that, kindly remind the person to credit the artist. Don't feel like it's your responsibility to source art for the people who post it.

### Adult content
Adult content is content that features sexual intercourse or exposed genitalia, or content that appears to be made with the intent to arouse or gratify the sexual desires of the viewer/reader. Content that features gore is generally not allowed, with the exception of things like candy gore and other cartoonish representations.
If somebody posts adult content outside the designated NSFW channels, delete the post yourself as soon as possible. This kind of thing should be handled privately, so send them a DM and explain that you deleted their post and kindly remind them of one of the appropriate channels they could send it in. Example:

"I had to delete your last post because it was NSFW, but feel free to send it in #general-nsfw if you'd like!"

## Violations
Handling things verbally is usually enough for most situations, but there are certain behaviors where disciplinary action is the most appropriate response. A violation represents a failure to comply with the server rules, and a moderator will have to take appropriate action corresponding to the severity of the violation:

### Minor Violations
Minor violations are acts of negligence, usually but not necessarily without ill intent. For a violation to be considered minor, the effects of the act must be non-serious and easily reversible or mitigable. The person should be given an official warning and be expected to change their behavior going forward.

<dl>
  <dt>INSUBORDINATION</dt>
  <dd>Provoking, arguing with, or failing to comply with a moderator.</dd>
  <dt>SPAM</dt>
  <dd>Repetitive, obnoxious behavior that the person knows or should know will make tedious the act of participating in the server.</dd>
</dl>

### Major Violations
Major violations are acts of serious negligence or malice. For a violation to be considered major, the person must show that they have either harmful intent, or an unwillingness to abide by the rules due to repeated violations. After committing a major violation, the offender should be immediately banned.

<dl>
  <dt>REPEATED INSUBORDINATION</dt>
  <dd>Failure to comply with moderators after multiple warnings.</dd>
  <dt>HARASSMENT</dt>
  <dd>Hostile remarks targeted at a specific user or group that a user is a part of.</dd>
  <dt>DISRUPTIVE BEHAVIOR</dt>
  <dd>Behavior that the person knows or should know will alarm, anger, disturb, or provoke others or generally disrupt the peace.</dd>
</dl>

## Cases
When a moderator performs a disciplinary action, they are required to do it through a special system so we can keep track of everything and be on the same page. Whenever you issue a warning or a ban through commands, a case is created. The case has details such as the case number, when it was created, who the offender is, the type of violation, and any further details. You can search for cases for a specific user with the command `/case list <user>`.

### Warnings
You can issue a warning with the command `/warn <user> <violation> <details>`. Once a user has accumulated `3` warnings, they will be automatically banned. Users may feel free to appeal warnings, but only through direct messaging, and it's ultimately up to the moderator to decide whether to carry out the repeal or not. You can repeal a warning with the command `/repeal <case-number>` and it will be removed from their name.

### Bans
Similarly, you can issue a ban with the command `/ban <user> <violation> <details>`. Appeals for bans will not be considered until 30 days following the ban, which can be found by looking at the case information with the command `/case info <case-number>`. You can repeal a ban with the command `/repeal <case-number>` with the case number of the ban, but note this will only work if it is past 30 days after the case creation date.
