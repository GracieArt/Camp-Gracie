# THE RULES

### 1. Be kind
Please be respectful to your fellow campers. Repeated rudeness will not be tolerated, nor will hate speech or discrimination of any kind. If anyone is making you uncomfortable, please let someone on the #staff know and we can help handle the situation. And if your behavior is making other people uncomfortable, please stop that behavior. Keep in mind that this is a shared space and we want everyone to feel safe and welcome.

### 2. Be civil
Keep drama, venting, sensitive topics, and political discussion to a minimum. If you must talk about any of these things, make sure that you talk about it in an open and respectful manner. Remember that this is a shared space and you must be respectful of everyone, even if you don't agree with them. But more often than not, these discussions are better suited for DMs.

### 3. Keep it SFW
The focus of this server is not on adult content and you must respect that. No NSFW content of any kind is allowed in the channels under the Main, Art, and Voice categories. There are however designated NSFW channels for when a certain topic or artwork wouldn't be appropriate to share elsewhere, but please don't post adult content just for the sake of adult content, this ain't the server for that. You need a special 18+ role to access these channels, so DM someone on the #staff and let them know your age to get it. Faking your age will result in a permanent ban.

### 4. Use each channel for its intended purpose
Small sidetracking is allowed if a discussion leads to it, but otherwise please try to move the conversation to the appropriate channel, so other people can use it for what it's meant for. Keep art to the art channel and advertising to the advertising channel, etc.

### 5. Don't spam
We define spamming as sending multiple messages in quick succession, which is obnoxious for people who have notifications on, or bumping up the chat by repeatedly sending messages that take up a lot of space, which just makes it difficult for other people to use the chat. This includes emoji spam, sticker spam, image spam, message spam, walls of text, roleplaying, and excessively pinging users.

### 6. Credit artwork
If you're posting someone else's art, please make sure you give appropriate credit. Either link the artist's post or cite their name. If you don't know the original artist, take the time and effort to find out, or just don't post it. (A useful website for finding sources is <https://saucenao.com>)
