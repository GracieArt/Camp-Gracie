# THE RULES
You must agree to these rules to get access to the server

### 1. 18+ only
Minors begone!

### 2. Be kind
Please be respectful to your fellow campers. Keep in mind that this is a shared space and we want everyone to feel safe and welcome.

### 3. Be civil
Please keep drama, sensitive topics, and political discussion out of the server.

### 4. Don't spam
This includes emoji spam, sticker spam, image spam, message spam, walls of text, roleplaying, advertising outside of #advertising, and excessively pinging users.

### 5. Credit artwork
If you're posting someone else's art, please make sure you give appropriate credit. Either link the artist's post or cite their name. If you don't know the original artist, take the time and effort to find out, or just don't post it. (A useful website for finding sources is <https://saucenao.com>)

### 6. NSFW content policy
No NSFW content of any kind is allowed outside of the designated NSFW channels. And please do not post adult content for the sake of adult content; this ain't a porn server. Also please continue to keep your demeanor respectful in these channels as well, keeping sexual talk to a minimum. There's other servers for that kind of stuff.
